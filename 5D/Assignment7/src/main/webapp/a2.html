    <p>As a kitchen utensil, spoon as usually placed around food and drinks, because it's affordance was designed to
        help human have a better experience of their food or help them to have an easier access for their food, the tail
        was design for a better hand grid and the head was design for action such as measure, mix, stir and toss.</p>
    <p>The first public space I choose is the escalator inside of the mall, because I think the shape of the spoon makes
        me feel like it can be used for an connections and the escalator can be design in similar form of the spoon and
        these kind of escalator can be placed in dinning area of the shopping mall to fit in the certain
        environment.</p>
    <p>My second thought of the design is I want to put the spoon in a public area where there are lots of people can
        enjoy the beautiful weather with their family. I want to create a fish pond by use the head of the spoon and
        lean the tail of the spoon to one building.</p>
